[Progress & Milestones]

January 8th
 * Intro to BeautifulSoup
 * Practiced extracting specific data from EPL website

January 22nd
 * Collected Kospi 200 constituents from KRX website
 * Collected data on changes in constituents
 * Intro to Pandas DataFrame
 * Parsed Excel File to Pandas Dataframe
 * Identified url to locate historical prices

January 29th
 * Web scraped adjusted prices for a given stock using BeautifulSoup
 * Calculated Share Price Change and appended the value to the DataFrame
 * Exported the DataFrame to a csv file

To Do:
 * Error handling for constituents that changed
 * Find source for sector data. Scrape and append to the same csv.
 * Visualize the data file using d3.js
 - first do it using just 1dummy row
 - try it on sliced table (5 rows)

Details for Visualization
 * Share price changes mapped on x scale
 * Market cap represented by the size of the bubble (scaled radius)
 * Indicate what sector the stock belongs to using color
 * Opacity for total trading volume?(but would need to extract this as well...)

Major Challenge
 * No access to Microsoft Excel - cannot modify the excel file
