[Progress & Milestones]

January 8th
 * Intro to BeautifulSoup
 * Practiced extracting specific data from EPL website

January 22nd
 * Collected Kospi 200 constituents from KRX website
 * Collected data on changes in constituents
 * Intro to Pandas DataFrame
 * Parsed Excel File to Pandas Dataframe
 * Identified url to locate historical prices

January 29th
 * Web scraped adjusted prices for a given stock using BeautifulSoup
 * Calculated Share Price Change and appended the value to the DataFrame
 * Exported the DataFrame to a csv file

February 3rd
 * d3.js course - completed 10%
 * implemented scale and mapped axis, full height ticks
 * displayed 5 sliced result

February 6th
 * d3.js course - completed 40%
 * adjusted circle sizes from linear scale radius to sqrt scale
 * implemented d3 force layout with fixed x position to prevent circle overlaps on y axis

February 10th
  * Error handling for changes in compostions
  * Detected stocks that changed and set initial date as date added.
  * Challenge: needed epoch timestamp to query yahoo finance. Made date-to-epoch time converter function.

FEBRAURY 11TH
* error handling (bug with SK change date)
* tested kospi200_scraper , passed 200 cases!

* url to extract industry/sector information
* challenge: not a consistent source for industry, sector. Too broad (so many categories)


FEBRUARY 20TH
*simple test to understand how multiprocess works

FEBRAURY 21st
*apply multiprocessing to kospi200_scraper
*time execution time and compare with original scraper (240 times faster!)
  - before:1min for 10 links, 20 mins for 200
  - after: 5 sec for 10 links, 1min 26 sec for 200
*extract sector&industry
- attempted to use selenium but was not able to extract data because
  Bloomberg checked if the access was from robots.

Goal:
threading to make scraping faster?
collect sector/industry data
plot 200 dots and see spacing
selective marking?
tip to display info when hover
kospi150



 To Do:
  * Error handling for constituents that changed
  * Find source for sector data. Scrape and append to the same csv.
  * Visualize the data file using d3.js
  - try it on sliced table (5 rows)
  * style the ticks & axis

 Details for Visualization
  * Share price changes mapped on x scale
  * Market cap represented by the size of the bubble (scaled radius)
  * Indicate what sector the stock belongs to using color
  * Opacity for total trading volume?(but would need to extract this as well...)

  Major Challenge
  * No access to Microsoft Excel - cannot modify the excel file
