February 6th
 * d3.js course - completed 40%
 * adjusted circle sizes from linear scale radius to sqrt scale
 * implemented d3 force layout with fixed x position to prevent circle overlaps on y axis

February 10th
  * Error handling for changes in compostions
  * Detected stocks that changed and set initial date as date added.
  * Challenge: needed epoch timestamp to query yahoo finance. Made date-to-epoch time converter function.



 To Do:
  * Error handling for constituents that changed
  * Find source for sector data. Scrape and append to the same csv.
  * Visualize the data file using d3.js
  - try it on sliced table (5 rows)
  * style the ticks & axis

 Details for Visualization
  * Share price changes mapped on x scale
  * Market cap represented by the size of the bubble (scaled radius)
  * Indicate what sector the stock belongs to using color
  * Opacity for total trading volume?(but would need to extract this as well...)

  Major Challenge
  * No access to Microsoft Excel - cannot modify the excel file
